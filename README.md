# Music Webscraping Code

I used webscraping techniques (Python BeautifulSoup package) to download and store music of specific categories as well as the respective information in a local folder as well as json file. 

All music is taken from [Looperman Website](https://www.looperman.com/)

The current categories taken are Bass/Bass Guitar/Bass Synth/Bass Wobble/Drum/Flute/Guitar Acoustic/Guitar Electric/Harp/Percussion/Piano/Scratch/Strings/Synth/Violin. This can be modified.
